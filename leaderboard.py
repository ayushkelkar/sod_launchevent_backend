# So this is the module for the leaderboards thing.
# Endpoint: /api/leaderboard
# Type: GET
# The JSON Payload looks like this: It is a list of dictionaries
# {
#   "leaderboard": [
#     { "teamName": "Quantum Wolves", "score": 9, "total": 10, "game": "quiz" },
#     { "teamName": "Photon Force",   "score": 7, "total": 10, "game": "quiz" }
#   ]
# }
# Basically its a list of dictionaries of: {teamname, score, total (default 10), game}
# So teamname can be gotten from the userid. Which can be indexed from the scores table.

# So you can't sort and save tables in SQLite. You can print them sorted, but not save them.

# This gets the userids as a list. So, we can use them to find teamids in teams.
